# leaflet-challenge
For this weeks challenge, the task was to use a provided JSON file from USGS and access it using d3 to create a leaflet visualization
using javascript, css and html. The resulting page has been made available using the github pages feature provided within github. The code is also
constantly updating the visualization as the dataset only includes earthquakes that have been recorded/reported over the past seven days.

*Due to time constraints only part 1 of this challenge has been completed and all files are directly available and not within a Part-1 folder.*
